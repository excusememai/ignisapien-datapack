Ignisapien Origin Datapack for Origins 1.20.1
**Introducing The Ignisapien:
The Ignisapien, reminiscent of flowing lava, wields fiery powers with finesse, yet their vulnerabilities to nocturnal chill, rain, and their diet of flame-grilled meats reveal the intricate balance between their infernal essence and earthly limitations. It's worth noting that this origin is a twin of the blazeborn.**

游릴 Infernal Birthright: Born from the heart of flames, Ignisapiens possess the ability to walk on lava, their very essence intertwined with the infernal elements. (Secondary Key Toggle)
游릴 Inferno Surge: Ignisapiens wield the power of Flame Burst, unleashing waves of scorching heat that engulf nearby foes, leaving them smoldering in the wake of their fiery wrath. (Primary Key Toggle)

游릵 Molten Hue: The flowing lava within an Ignisapien imbues them with lava drips from their body, a visual testament to the fiery currents coursing through their veins, marking them as children of the inferno.

游린 Tempest Barrier: Despite their mastery over flames, the torrential forces of rain, water, and thunderstorms disrupt the abilities of Ignisapiens, rendering them inert until the skies clear, for even the mightiest inferno must yield to the power of nature's wrath.
游린 Twilight Frailty: Under the shroud of night, the chill of the air seeps into the molten core of an Ignisapien, solidifying their lava essence, slowing their movements, and rendering them brittle against the cold embrace of darkness.
游린 Inferno Diet: Fueled by the essence of fire, Ignisapiens find sustenance in meats, fish, and even the decaying remnants of flesh, for only the flame-grilled essence of such sustenance can kindle the infernal flames that course through their veins, sustaining their fiery vitality.
